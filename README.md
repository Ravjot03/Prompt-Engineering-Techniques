# Prompt Engineering Techniques

## Why Prompt Engineering matters?
Prompt engineering involves crafting precise prompts to guide AI models, improving the accuracy and relevance of their outputs. It's essential for applications like chatbots, content creation, and automated support systems.

## What is a Prompt?
A prompt for a language model is a set of instructions or input provided by a user to guide the model's response, 
helping it understand the context and generate relevant and coherent language-based output, such as answering questions, completing sentences, or engaging in a conversation.

## Different types of Prompt Templates
The prompt template classes in Langchain are built to make constructing prompts with dynamic inputs easier.

LangChain offers various prompt templates, including:

- **Normal Prompt Template:** Basic instructions for the model.
- **Few-Shot Prompt Template:** Provides a few examples to guide the model.
- **Chat Prompt Template:** Designed for natural and engaging dialogue generation.
- **Instruction Extractor Template:** Detailed prompts that guide the model to extract and follow instructions.

## Output Parsing using LLM Chains
LangChainâ€™s output parsers provide a way to enforce specific formatting rules. For instance, by using a JSON-based approach, we ensure the model returns data in a structured format that can be easily parsed and validated. The parser handles edge cases, such as inconsistent delimiters or extra whitespace, which are common issues when dealing with free-form text.

This [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Prompt-Engineering-Techniques/blob/main/OutputParsing_in_LLMChains.ipynb) - illustrates how prompt engineering and structured output generation can be optimized. By leveraging JSON and chaining techniques, we can build powerful, scalable solutions that produce clean, reliable outputs.
