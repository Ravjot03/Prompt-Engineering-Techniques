# Prompt Engineering Techniques

## What is a Prompt?
A prompt for a language model is a set of instructions or input provided by a user to guide the model's response, 
helping it understand the context and generate relevant and coherent language-based output, such as answering questions, completing sentences, or engaging in a conversation.

## Prompt Template
The prompt template classes in Langchain are built to make constructing prompts with dynamic inputs easier.
