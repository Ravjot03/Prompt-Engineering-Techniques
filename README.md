# Prompt Engineering Techniques

## Why Prompt Engineering matters?
Prompt engineering involves crafting precise prompts to guide AI models, improving the accuracy and relevance of their outputs. It's essential for applications like chatbots, content creation, and automated support systems.

## What is a Prompt?
A prompt for a language model is a set of instructions or input provided by a user to guide the model's response, 
helping it understand the context and generate relevant and coherent language-based output, such as answering questions, completing sentences, or engaging in a conversation.

## Prompt Template
The prompt template classes in Langchain are built to make constructing prompts with dynamic inputs easier.

LangChain offers various prompt templates, including:

- **Normal Prompt Template:** Basic instructions for the model.
- **Few-Shot Prompt Template:** Provides a few examples to guide the model.
- **Chat Prompt Template:** Designed for natural and engaging dialogue generation.
- **Instruction Extractor Template:** Detailed prompts that guide the model to extract and follow instructions.
